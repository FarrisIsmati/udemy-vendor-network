# STEPS WHEN RECORDING DB

SETUP
0. Describe network, and CI/CD workflow
(Note this is not a course to learn about AWS networking in depth but will cover it in a practical sense)
(VPC -> Route Tables -> Subnets | attach IGW to RT | attach natgw to private RT | eip attach to IGW)
(~~~NOTES~~~)
1. Create github-oidc-terraform role (setup OPENID connect)
2. Setup github repo + .gitignore
3. Setup github actions
(Store secrets)

ACTIONS
1. main.yml (Copy paste & describe code & state what needs to be replaced)

TERRAFORM
1. main.tf (quick)
2. variables.tf (copy/paste show what to replace)
3. vpc.tf (Create, check if created in AWS)
4. subnets.tf (Create, check if created in AWS) (Public is subnet with RT that has a IGW private is one that does not)
5. route table + igw (Create rt, then igw when needed)
6. nat-gateways.tf (Create, see if attached to igw)
(explain is needed for interent connectivity for private subnets)
(prevents hosts on internet from initiating connections to these instances)
7. eip.tf (Create, see if attached to igw) 
(must assign an EIP if you want your instance to be reachable from the internet over IPV4)
8. Our network is setup, now we can start creating resources that will be able to communicate with no issues
